The goal of this project for me was to focus on the logic within JS, do as much as possible from scratch and implement industry best practices via the Model/View/Controller separation of concerns.
The assignment was to:
- [] Follow a design spec
- [] Render the 3 menu options using JavaScript
- [] Be able to add/remove items
- [] Have a payment modal with compulsory form inputs
- [] Practice implementing basic JavaScript concepts; .map(), .reduce(), .join(), for loop, classes, arrow functions, data-attributes, DOM manipulation
